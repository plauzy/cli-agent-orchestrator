"""Narrow worker broker for the CAO elastic Kubernetes topology.

The broker is the only component in the fleet that can create a pod, and it is
deliberately the smallest surface that can: a client names an agent profile and
a provider, and gets back a lease. Image, command, volumes, service account and
resource limits are all broker-controlled, so a compromised supervisor cannot
turn `assign_elastic` into arbitrary pod creation.

It is also the fleet's only supervision point. CAO decides a turn is over by
watching the agent's TUI, which means an agent that speaks before its first tool
call gets its terminal killed and its task reported as a success (measured: 3.1s
on a task needing 36s). The supervisor cannot tell that apart from real success,
so it never releases the lease. The broker can: it holds the lease, it knows
`complete_assignment` never arrived, and it reaps on a deadline and records WHY.
`GET /workers` is where that truth is legible - see the reaper below.

The broker is also the workers' narrow gateway to supervisor-owned state.
NetworkPolicy denies workers any direct route to the supervisor control API;
the broker authenticates each worker's release token and forwards only inbox
delivery and the four explicit memory operations.

Finally it is the operator's way in. Worker Services are ClusterIP and last only
as long as a task, so `cao worker` cannot port-forward to each one; instead it
holds the broker token and the broker forwards an allowlisted set of read and
send routes to the worker it names. See the operator plane at the end of this
file for what is on that list and why.

# It used to, unconditionally, and that single `await` was the largest term in
# placement latency: 22s of a 22s call, of which 16s was the worker's own boot.
# Worse, readiness was never the condition the caller actually needed. The caller
# reaches the worker through its SERVICE, and a pod passing its readiness probe
# is not yet a Service with a published endpoint and every node's rules
# programmed - so the gate was simultaneously slow AND too weak, and a
# five-way fan-out reliably lost a worker to `connect timeout=10.0` on a pod that
# `kubectl` showed as 1/1 Running.
#
# So the lease is now returned as soon as the Deployment and Service exist, and the

    This is what replaced `activeDeadlineSeconds`, and the replacement was forced

    the Kubernetes-side cap that used to hold when the broker was not reaping had
    to move into the broker. Which sounds circular, and is not quite: what breaks
    a lease is not the process dying, it is the process forgetting.

    Leases live in this process's memory. A broker restart therefore forgets every
    one of them, and the ordinary reaper walks `_leases` -- so a worker minted by
    the previous incarnation can never be settled by the next one, no matter how
    long it runs. Under Jobs those orphans died on the Kubernetes deadline about an
    hour later. Nothing else would collect them: their Service is ClusterIP, their
    pod is Ready, and the supervisor terminal holding the release token is gone
    too.

    **Age, not absence of a lease, is the trigger.** A broker that restarts while
    five workers are mid-task must not kill five running tasks -- under Jobs it
    did not, and a task that finishes can still reach `/complete`. So an orphan
    gets the same WORKER_TIMEOUT it always had, measured from DEPLOYMENT creation,
    and only then is it swept. Pod age is not equivalent: a node drain or eviction
    replaces the pod and resets its creation timestamp, which could otherwise
    keep a forgotten Deployment alive forever.

    A worker with a LIVE lease is never touched here: the reaper owns those, with
    reasons this function cannot supply. A worker whose lease has already settled
    is fair game, because settling calls `_release` -- so if the workload is still
    standing, that release failed, and this is the retry.

      or the pod restarted or was replaced under the lease. The terminal-ended
      signal catches the TUI turn-detection race directly; Pod phase cannot see a
      dead tmux window while cao-server remains running.
    - `failed`: the pod never reported Ready within READY_TIMEOUT - unschedulable,
      ImagePullBackOff, a crash-looping entrypoint. This case used to be caught
      synchronously inside POST /workers, which is why the lease could be handed
      back only after a wait nobody wanted; see GATE_ON_READY. Moving it here
      keeps the deadline and gives up only exactness about when it is noticed.
    - `expired`: the pod is still Ready but /complete never arrived within
      COMPLETION_TIMEOUT. Without this the pod squats a whole node's worth of
      memory until the orphan sweep collects it, an hour later.

    The restart case is the one thing the Deployment made the reaper responsible
    for. Under a Job, `restartPolicy: Never` and `backoffLimit: 0` meant a worker
    that died stayed dead, and the existing "pod gone" and "pod Failed" branches
    caught it. A Deployment brings it back, so without the check below the reaper

# Operator plane: `cao worker` reaching a leased worker from outside the cluster.
#
# Everything above this line is the fleet talking to itself. This is for a human,
# or the CLI acting for one, holding the broker token: one port-forward to the
# broker reaches every worker. Port-forwarding each worker instead is not a
# workflow - their Services are ClusterIP and exist only for the length of a
# task, so the name to forward to does not exist until a lease is taken and is
# gone before anyone types it.
#
# It is an allowlist of (method, path) and not a pass-through, for a reason worth
# stating plainly: cao-server is an unauthenticated command-execution surface, so
# forwarding arbitrary paths would publish the whole of it, on every worker, to
# anyone holding one token. The list below is what `cao worker list/status/send`
# and `cao worker sessions/attach` actually call, and nothing else.
#
# `POST /terminals/{id}/input` IS on it. That types into a live agent, which
# sounds like the line not to cross, but the same token already creates and
# deletes workers outright - being able to talk to a worker you can delete is not
# an escalation, and `cao worker send` is the verb the whole plane exists for.
#
# Adding a route is a one-line change here. Deleting the allowlist is not a
# simplification.

    The Service name is the obvious address and it does not work from here. On EKS
    with the VPC CNI's NetworkPolicy agent, a pod's egress is matched against the
    address the pod DIALLED, before kube-proxy rewrites it - so a rule written as
    `to: podSelector: cao-elastic-worker` never matches traffic aimed at a worker's
    ClusterIP, and the connection hangs until it times out. Proven on a live
    cluster: from this pod, the worker's pod IP connects in 0.00s and its ClusterIP
    times out, and adding that one ClusterIP to the policy as an ipBlock makes it
    connect. The supervisor reaches workers by Service name only because its own
    egress rule is `podSelector: {}` with no ports - an allow-all the agent does not
    have to resolve.

    The alternative was an ipBlock for the whole Service CIDR on 9889, which would
    let the broker reach every ClusterIP in the cluster to buy back an address it
    does not need. Dialling the pod directly stays inside the existing podSelector
    rule, and the pod is looked up per request, so a ReplicaSet replacement is
    picked up on the next call rather than cached into a 502.
