"""Offline exercise of broker.py: object construction + lease lifecycle.

Stubs the API server so the whole request path can run on a laptop. The point is
to catch what only shows up at the first lease on a live cluster - a misspelled
kwarg on a V1* model, a Deployment body the serializer mangles, a reaper that
never releases. Every V1* object is pushed through the client's real serializer,
which is what actually rejects a bad field name.

NOT part of the CAO test suite: broker.py lives outside the package and needs
fastapi + the Kubernetes client, neither of which is a CAO dependency. Run it in
a throwaway environment:

    uv venv /tmp/brokertest --python 3.12
    VIRTUAL_ENV=/tmp/brokertest uv pip install \\
        "fastapi>=0.104.0" "kubernetes>=30.0.0,<35.0.0" httpx
    /tmp/brokertest/bin/python examples/cao-clusters/kubernetes/eks/test_broker.py

Exits non-zero on the first failing expectation, and prints a PASS/FAIL line per
check.
