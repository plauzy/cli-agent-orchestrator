# You.com Web Research Example

A ready-to-run research agent profile that wires the [You.com MCP server](https://you.com/docs)
into a CAO terminal through the profile's `mcpServers` remote-URL mechanism —
no code, no local dependencies, one config entry.

The agent answers questions that depend on current web information using the
`you-search` MCP tool (current web search with snippets, and optional full page
content via its `extraction: full_page` option), and cites its sources. URL
content extraction from specific arbitrary URLs with the dedicated
`you-contents` tool requires the authenticated endpoint (see below).

## How It Works

CAO agent profiles support remote MCP servers directly:

```yaml
mcpServers:
  youcom:
    type: http
    url: https://api.you.com/mcp?profile=free
```

The entry above uses You.com's keyless endpoint — no API key or account
needed. The URL-server shape passes through to providers unchanged (see
[Agent profiles](../../docs/agent-profile.md)); providers that support remote
HTTP transports (for example Claude Code, Grok, and MiniMax Code) connect to it
at launch. The profile pins `provider: claude_code` for this reason — the
default `kiro_cli` provider's support for remote `type: http` MCP servers is
undocumented, so launching on defaults could silently produce an agent with no
search tools. Swap the `provider` key (or pass `--provider` at launch) to run
it on another HTTP-capable provider.

The profile also keeps `cao-mcp-server` configured so the agent can still be
targeted by supervisors via `handoff`/`assign` — it works both standalone and
inside a fleet.

## Setup

```bash
# 1. Install the profile
cao install examples/youcom-search/youcom_researcher.md

# 2. Launch it
cao launch youcom_researcher
```

Then ask anything that needs current information:

## Authenticated Endpoint (optional)

The keyless `profile=free` endpoint is **search-only**: it exposes `you-search`
(and `you-discover`) and does **not** include the `you-contents` URL-fetch
tool, so the example's default configuration does not advertise arbitrary-URL
extraction. Page content is available through `you-search`'s `extraction`
option — `highlights` (the default) returns query-relevant passages, and
`full_page` crawls each result and returns full page content; its companion
`extraction_source` option (`cache`, `fetch`, `blend`) controls where the
content comes from and what it bills — `cache` is included in base cost,
`fetch` bills at live-crawl rates, and `blend` bills only for pages not in
cache. For the full You.com MCP toolset, including `you-contents`, use the
authenticated endpoint:

```yaml
mcpServers:
  youcom:
    type: http
    url: https://api.you.com/mcp
```

and configure `YDC_API_KEY` bearer auth (get a key at
[you.com/platform/api-keys](https://you.com/platform/api-keys)). How the
bearer header is attached depends on the provider's MCP client; check your
provider's remote-MCP auth options. Keep the key in your provider's MCP
client config or environment — do not paste it into the profile markdown,
which is meant to be shared and committed. Alternatively, run the skill-based
setup from [youdotcom-oss/agent-skills](https://github.com/youdotcom-oss/agent-skills)
(`npx skills add youdotcom-oss/agent-skills`), which routes agents to the
lightest You.com surface for the host. That command executes third-party
code from the registry, so verify the publisher matches `youdotcom-oss`
before running it.

## Data flow

Every search query (and any page a `full_page` extraction crawls) is sent to
`api.you.com` — a third-party service. On the authenticated endpoint, every
`you-contents` URL fetch is sent there too. The keyless `profile=free`
endpoint has no account boundary or audit trail. Do not include sensitive,
secret, or repo-local content in research queries; assume anything the agent
sends in a query leaves the machine.

## Notes

- The profile uses `role: reviewer`, whose native tool defaults are
  read-only. Be aware that adding the `youcom` MCP server re-introduces
  network egress (search queries, pages crawled by `full_page` extraction,
  and, on the authenticated endpoint, arbitrary URL fetch) that the reviewer
  role's defaults deliberately exclude — the role label alone does not make
  this agent network-sandboxed. The profile's security constraints are
  prompt-level guidance, not an enforced boundary. Widen `allowedTools` in
  the profile if you want the agent to also edit files based on its findings.
- Search results and fetched page content are external data; the profile
  instructs the agent to treat them as untrusted evidence, not instructions.
