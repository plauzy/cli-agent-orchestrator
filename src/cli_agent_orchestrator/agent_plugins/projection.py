"""Skill delivery: project plugin skills into CAO's existing global skill store.

This is the highest-consequence design decision in the feature, so the reasoning
is recorded here rather than only in the spec.

CAO delivers skills through **three** independent mechanisms and only one goes
through :func:`~cli_agent_orchestrator.utils.skills.list_skills`:

===============================  =========================================  ====================
Mechanism                        Reads from                                 Providers
===============================  =========================================  ====================
Runtime catalog                  ``list_skills()`` → ``_skill_search_dirs``  Claude Code, Codex,
                                                                            Kimi, Antigravity
Baked catalog (install time)     ``list_skills()``                          Copilot
Native, filesystem-direct        ``SKILLS_DIR`` **path, literally**         Kiro CLI, OpenCode
===============================  =========================================  ====================

The obvious approach — appending plugin roots to ``_skill_search_dirs()``
alongside ``get_extra_skill_dirs()`` — covers the first two rows with a
one-function change and **cannot** cover the third. Kiro receives only
``skill://`` globs rooted at ``SKILLS_DIR`` and OpenCode's ``skills`` entry is a
single symlink to ``SKILLS_DIR``; plugin skills stored anywhere else are
invisible to both, including CAO's own default provider.

Because these skills are materialized as *symlinks*, ``install_service`` emits a
single-level ``*/SKILL.md`` glob alongside the recursive one — ``**`` does not
have one agreed meaning for directory symlinks, and the stricter reading would
hide every projected skill from Kiro. See the comment at that emission site.

So each valid plugin skill is materialized **inside** ``SKILLS_DIR``::

    SKILLS_DIR/<skill-name>  ->  AGENT_PLUGINS_DIR/<plugin-name>/skills/<skill-name>

Zero provider changes. Every already-tested delivery path is inherited unmodified,
and the terminal-launch path gains no new filesystem scan — projected entries
land in a directory ``build_skill_catalog()`` already scans.

Projection is **derived state**, never a source of truth: it is rebuilt from
scratch from the installed set on every add/remove/update, and swept for
dangling links. The previous projection is read back from the install records'
``projected_skill_names``, which is also what makes ``provenance.py`` a
pure record lookup and what lets a rebuild notice that a collision's winner
changed.

    held it and the record write failed", the failure swallowed with a warning.
    The caller — ``cao skills add --force`` — could not tell the two apart, so on
    a failure it went on to unlink the projection and copy the user's directory
    into place while the record still claimed the name. The next rebuild's sweep
    then deleted that directory by name.

    The failure premise is real rather than theoretical: records live under the
    store's ``state_dir`` while projections live in ``SKILLS_DIR`` — two
    independent trees, so a full or read-only state volume fails the record write
    while the copy into the skill store succeeds.

    """Drop ``skill_name`` from whichever plugin record still claims it.

    Called when a user installs a skill of the same name over a projected one
    (``cao skills add <folder> --force``). Reproduced by review on #584: the
    previous projection was reconstructed from the records, so the record kept
    claiming a name the user now owned, and a later ``cao plugin remove``
    recursively deleted the *user's* directory while an intervening rebuild
    overwrote it with the plugin's copy.

    Transferring the claim fixes both halves with the machinery that already
    exists rather than a second ownership mechanism:

    * ``_sweep`` only removes names the *previous* projection owned, so a
      released name is never swept.
    * ``_preexisting_skill_names`` treats any unmanaged name in the skill store
      as pre-existing, so the next rebuild sees a user-owned skill and the plugin
      loses the collision with a ``SKIPPED`` finding — which is precisely the
      documented "a user-added skill always wins" rule, now true regardless of
      the order the two installs happened in.

    Three outcomes, distinguishable — this function is tri-state on purpose:

    * returns the plugin name — the claim was released and committed;
    * returns ``None`` — no installed plugin claimed the name, nothing to do;
    * raises :class:`ProjectionClaimError` — a plugin claimed it and the release
      could **not** be committed. The caller must abort whatever it was going to
      do next; proceeding is what deletes a user's skill directory later.

    The find-owner → write-remaining sequence runs inside the store lock (see
    :meth:`InstalledPluginStore.release_projected_name`) so it cannot revert a
    concurrent publish.

    The defence-in-depth half of review finding F2. Phase one of the sweep used
    to remove ``previous - current`` **by name only** — no structural check at
    all, while phase two right below it already had the realpath-containment test
    it needed. So a name that a stale record still claimed was enough to
    ``shutil.rmtree`` whatever sat at that name, including a real directory the
    user had just installed there. A name match must never be sufficient to
    delete a real directory.

    A symlink resolving inside the plugin store is *structurally* ours, which is
    the reliable proof and the same test ``_preexisting_skill_names`` trusts. A
    real directory carries no such marker, so it is treated as ours only when the
    projection is running in copy mode, where a real directory is the shape we
    place. In symlink mode — the default, and the mode the reported failure
    happens in — a real directory is by definition not ours and survives.

    Residual, deliberately conservative: a copy-mode projection left over from an
    earlier copy-mode rebuild is not swept by a later symlink-mode rebuild. It is
    then classified as pre-existing, so the user keeps the directory and the
    plugin loses the collision — over-preservation rather than data loss, and
