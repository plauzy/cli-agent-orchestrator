"""Client for a CAO fleet's worker broker.

`cao fleet` and `cao worker` talk to a broker over HTTP. They do not talk to
Kubernetes, and that is the point of this module living in core: the contract is
four routes and one token, so the same commands work against the EKS broker in
`examples/cao-clusters/kubernetes/eks`, against any other broker that implements
them, and against a stub in a test — with no kubernetes import anywhere in `src/`.

The contract:

    GET    /workers                     reconciled workload and lease inventory
    DELETE /workers/{id}                release one worker
    GET    /workers/{id}/logs           the worker container's log
    GET|POST /workers/{id}/api/{path}   an allowlisted cao-server call, proxied

The last one is what makes `cao worker` possible at all. A worker's cao-server is
not reachable from outside its cluster — on EKS its Service is ClusterIP and
exists only for the length of one task — so the broker forwards a fixed set of
read and send routes to whichever worker the caller names. It is an allowlist on
the broker's side, so a route this client does not use is a route it cannot reach.

One port-forward to the broker is therefore the whole setup:

    kubectl -n cao-cluster port-forward svc/cao-worker-broker 9890:9890
    export CAO_ELASTIC_BROKER_URL=http://127.0.0.1:9890
    export CAO_ELASTIC_BROKER_TOKEN=...
