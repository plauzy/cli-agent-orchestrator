# ── removal + install-side ownership guard (design.md §10a) ──────────────────
#
# OpenCode's shared ``opencode.json`` is edited in place: ``upsert_mcp_server``
# is upsert-only and there is no delete. Two consequences the helpers below fix:
#
#   * Removal (Finding 1). A plugin server no longer delivered must be DISABLED,
#     not deleted (CAO must never delete a key it may not own) and not left
#     ``enabled: true`` (its ``command`` points at a ``PLUGIN_ROOT`` that removal
#     just deleted, so OpenCode would try to spawn a missing executable on every
#     launch). ``disable_mcp_server`` writes a JSON boolean ``false`` — OpenCode
#     1.18.15 gates the spawn on a strict ``enabled === false``, so ``"false"``,
#     ``0`` or a missing ``type`` would NOT stop it (see
#     ``docs/issues/573-agent-plugins/opencode-verification.md``).
#
#   * Install-side clobber (Finding 2). Writing a plugin-derived server whose
#     name collides with a user's hand-written entry would silently destroy the
#     user's config. ``is_cao_owned_mcp_entry`` decides whether an existing entry
#     is safe to overwrite.
#
# PROVENANCE IS A HEURISTIC, NOT A FACT. ``opencode.json`` records no owner, so
# the only signal available without persisted state (install-record / marker
# key — design.md §10a options 1 and 2, deliberately out of scope here) is that
# a CAO-delivered plugin server's ``command``/``environment`` were expanded from
# ``${PLUGIN_ROOT}``/``${PLUGIN_DATA}`` and therefore point INSIDE the plugin
# store. A *stale* CAO entry written under a different ``CAO_HOME_DIR`` points at
# the OLD store and is thus indistinguishable from a user's entry; it is treated
# conservatively (reported as a collision, never overwritten).

    Three ways an existing entry is provably CAO's, and therefore safe to replace:

    1. It is byte-for-byte what CAO would write now (idempotent replay — a
       reinstall/refresh re-writes CAO's own entry every time, and that must not
       be misreported as a user collision or the server could never be delivered
       twice). Overwriting an entry equal to the candidate is a no-op anyway.
    2. Its command resolves **inside the plugin store**, whatever its
       ``enabled`` state. The plugin store is a CAO-managed directory that only
       CAO ever writes into, so a command rooted there is CAO's own delivery by
       construction — this is the recorded-ownership signal, derived from the
       very bytes being compared rather than from a side table that can go stale
       or be lost while ``opencode.json`` persists.
    3. (Subsumed by 2, kept explicit for readers) a CAO-*disabled* entry inside
       the plugin store — a server CAO delivered and then disabled on a prior
       uninstall. Re-enabling it on reinstall is safe.

    Anything else — an entry that differs and does not resolve into the plugin
    store — is treated as user-owned and must NOT be overwritten.

    Reproduced by review on #584: condition 2 was previously gated on
    ``enabled is False``, so a force update that changed a plugin server's
    command, args or env made the entry differ from both the candidate and the
    disabled shape. CAO then misclassified **its own** enabled entry as
    user-owned, left the stale v1 command in ``opencode.json`` and dropped the
    agent's tool grant because the v2 entry was skipped. The same path broke a
    lexicographic winner transition between two plugins. Widening the ownership
    test to any in-store command lets CAO update its own entries while leaving
    the guard at full strength for genuinely user-authored ones, which by
    definition do not point into CAO's plugin store.
