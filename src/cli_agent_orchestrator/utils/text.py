#   prompt stays glued mid-stream and the per-line idle check at

    Handles CSI sequences (colors, cursor movement, erase), OSC sequences

    carriage returns to newlines so regex anchors (^/$) work correctly.

    WARNING: This function does NOT render carriage returns — it normalizes
    bare \\r to \\n. In a real terminal, \\r moves the cursor to column 0 so the
    next write overwrites the current line (used by spinners, progress bars).
    Here, each \\r becomes a new line, so spinner frames like "⠋ Thinking..."
    will appear as separate lines rather than collapsing into one. This is
    acceptable for status detection (pattern matching still works) but NOT
    suitable for extracting user-visible output.

    Used for status detection on raw FIFO buffer output.
    For message extraction, use tmux capture-pane which renders the terminal.
