"""Fleet commands for CLI Agent Orchestrator.

`cao fleet` is the fleet-wide view of what `cao worker` shows one row of. Both
speak to a broker over HTTP and neither knows what Kubernetes is; see
`utils/fleet.py` for the contract and the one port-forward it needs.

Note the name that is already taken: `cao shutdown` stops tmux sessions on THIS
machine. `cao fleet shutdown` releases workers in a remote cluster. They are
different verbs on different things, which is why the second one is spelled out.

    There is no verb here that builds a fleet. A fleet is deployed by its own
    manifests — for EKS, `examples/cao-clusters/kubernetes/eks/deploy.sh` — and
    these commands operate one that already exists. `shutdown` is not the inverse
    of a create: it releases workers and leaves the fleet standing.

    This group is the fleet as a whole. For one worker — talk to its agent, read
    its log, release just it — see `cao worker`, which reads the same two
    environment variables. It is a sibling rather than a subgroup because a
    worker is addressed the same way whatever the fleet runs on.
