"""Worker commands for CLI Agent Orchestrator.

`cao worker` is `cao session` for an agent that is not on this machine. The verbs
line up on purpose — list, status, send, sessions — because the thing at the other
end IS a cao-server; only the route to it differs, and it differs enough that it
cannot be the same command. See `utils/fleet.py` for that route.

What is deliberately NOT here: create. Workers are minted by a supervisor agent
calling `assign_elastic`, sized to the task it is delegating. A `cao worker create`
would make an agentless worker, which nothing then talks to.
