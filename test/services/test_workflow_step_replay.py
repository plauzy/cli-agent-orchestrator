"""Tests for single-step re-execution against a recorded run (issue #640).

Covers ``workflow_service.replay_single_step``:

- happy path: the step's prompt resolves from the journaled inputs + the recorded
  predecessor's output, and the step runs once
- the replayed step's structured output is read back from the DERIVED key, whose
  40-char prefix + ``-replay-`` + 16-hex nonce exactly fills the 64-char name cap
- each replay is INDEPENDENT, in all three senses the derived key has to deliver:
  sequentially (a later replay emitting nothing reports ``None``), CONCURRENTLY
  (two replays of the same step never read each other's output), and against a
  REAL run whose id happens to be ``<source>-replay``
- the derived slot is RELEASED after the read-back, so a replay leaves the store
  no larger than it found it
- the SOURCE run is untouched: its journal rows and its own store entry are
  byte-identical after a replay
- ``prompt_override`` replaces the TEMPLATE, and ``{{...}}`` inside the override
  still resolves against the recorded run; an empty override is rejected
- error taxonomy: unknown run / unknown step (KeyError), script tier + unresolvable
  predecessor (ValueError), corrupt snapshot (ResumeCorruptError)
- a step that fails is reported in the payload, never raised

``run_agent_step`` is mocked — no real terminals. The journal points at a temp
SQLite DB via the patched DATABASE_FILE; the two migrators create the tables in a
fixture. Runs are seeded through the journal DAL directly (not by driving the
engine), so each test states exactly the recorded state it replays against.
