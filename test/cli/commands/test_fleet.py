"""Tests for the `cao fleet` command group.

Two commands, and the second one destroys things: `cao fleet shutdown` deletes
running agent sessions in a shared cluster, and a released worker's state volume
goes with it. So most of what is asserted here is about restraint --

- a settled lease is never released again (it is already gone, and asking would
  turn a clean shutdown into an error),
- the confirmation prompt lists what is about to die before asking,
- declining releases nothing,
- one unreachable worker does not strand the rest, because the reason to run
  this command at all is that something is already wrong.

`cao fleet status` gets the same treatment for a smaller reason: its `Live:` and
`States:` lines answer different questions -- now, and since the last hour of
history -- and a reader who conflates them reads chapter 4's finished fan-out as
a fleet that is still burning nodes.

The client is stubbed at `FleetClient.from_env`, which is also the seam the
module's own design intends: no broker, no cluster, no `kubernetes` import.
