and this project adheres to [Semantic Versioning](https://semver.org/spec/v2.0.0.html).

## [Unreleased]

### Added

- **OpenCode CLI provider** — Full integration with [OpenCode](https://opencode.ai), a terminal-based AI assistant whose native agent format (Markdown + YAML frontmatter) maps directly onto CAO profiles. Supports `cao install --provider opencode_cli`, all five terminal states (IDLE, PROCESSING, COMPLETED, WAITING_USER_ANSWER, ERROR), permission translation from CAO `allowedTools` to OpenCode `permission:` frontmatter, MCP server wiring via a CAO-owned `opencode.json`, and config isolation from the user's personal OpenCode setup. CAO's on-disk config directory for OpenCode is `~/.aws/opencode/` — users who installed an earlier pre-release build (which used `~/.aws/opencode_cli`) must re-run `cao install --provider opencode_cli` to populate the new location. The old directory can be removed with: `rm -rf ~/.aws/opencode_cli`. Provider docs: [`docs/opencode-cli.md`](docs/opencode-cli.md).
## [2.1.0] - 2026-04-22

### Added

- **`cao session` command group + HTTP-based CLI refactor (#187)** — New `cao session list | status | send` commands for inspecting and driving running sessions from the CLI. `cao shutdown` and `cao launch` now go through the HTTP API instead of direct service calls, enabling a local CLI to drive a remote `cao-server`. `cao launch` also gains `--working-directory` and an optional trailing `message` argument for one-shot headless task execution. New `cao-session-management` skill documents the command group for LLM-driven operators.
- **External plugins support (#172)** — Observer/hook plugins can now be installed via pip and auto-discovered through the `cao.plugins` entry point group. Plugins subclass `CaoPlugin` and register handlers with the `@hook` decorator. See [docs/plugins.md](docs/plugins.md).
- **Skills system (#145, #154, #170)** — Native support for reusable agent skills installed to `~/.cao/skills/` via `cao skill add`. New `cao-provider` skill guides contributors through adding new CLI agent providers; `cao-supervisor-protocols` and `cao-worker-protocols` seeded via `cao init`. Managed-skills section added to README.
- **Kiro CLI full TUI mode + `--legacy-ui` fallback (#138, #163)** — Support for Kiro CLI's new full-screen TUI alongside the legacy prompt; `--legacy-ui` flag preserved for compatibility.
- **Agent-profile environment variable injection (#156)** — Agent profiles can declare `env` entries that are loaded into the agent process at launch, with secret-aware handling via `~/.cao/.env`.
- **`allowedTools` universal tool restriction (#125, #144)** — Unified CAO tool-restriction vocabulary translated per-provider, replacing provider-specific allow/deny flags. Child agents honor explicit `allowedTools=["*"]` instead of silently inheriting parent restrictions.
- **Web UI bundled in Python wheel (#169)** — Built Web UI assets now ship inside the wheel, so `uv tool install git+https://github.com/awslabs/cli-agent-orchestrator.git` gives you the dashboard with no extra build steps.

### Changed

- **Launch prompt clarity + `--auto-approve` (#146)** — Redesigned the `cao launch` confirmation prompt to show `Role` instead of `Blocked`, clearly distinguish `[Y]` / `[--auto-approve]` / `[--yolo]`, and added `--auto-approve` flag to skip the prompt without removing restrictions (for automated flows, scripts, and agent-to-agent launches).

### Fixed

- **Terminal-service cleanup guard (#191)** — `_create_terminal` no longer kills sessions it didn't create during rollback: the cleanup path now tracks whether this call actually created the tmux session (`session_created` fact) instead of the `new_session` intent flag. Prevents collateral damage to pre-existing sessions when terminal creation fails partway through.
- **Claude Code false-positive IDLE on shell prompt (#190)** — Initialize-time status check could return IDLE against the pre-existing zsh/bash `❯` prompt before Claude Code actually started. Added pre-launch pane snapshot + Claude-specific startup markers to confirm the CLI is actually running before accepting IDLE.
- **Claude Code structural PROCESSING detection (#177)** — `get_status()` now uses structural detection for PROCESSING instead of relying on `❯` position, eliminating a race where the spinner and prompt interleaved mid-capture.
- **Stale processing spinners no longer block Claude Code inbox delivery (#106)** — The inbox watchdog no longer gets stuck on lingering spinner output after a response completes, so messages to Claude Code workers are delivered reliably.
- **Profile-level `model` honored at terminal creation (#189)** — Providers now pass `profile.model` through to the CLI at launch, so per-agent model selection works end-to-end.
- **Kiro CLI 2.0 Credits-before-separator layout (#188)** — Status detection updated for the new Kiro TUI layout where the credits line appears before the separator.
- **Kiro CLI position-aware "Kiro is working" check (#185)** — Stale scrollback could leave "Kiro is working" in the capture after completion and block handoffs with a false PROCESSING; detection is now position-aware to the latest interaction.
- **Kiro CLI new TUI fallback patterns (#140)** — Added fallback detection patterns for the new Kiro CLI TUI prompt format (`ask a question, or describe a task`), ensuring CAO works even if `--legacy-ui` is removed in a future version.
- **Agent profile exception handling (#140, resolves #137)** — `load_agent_profile()` no longer wraps `FileNotFoundError` as `RuntimeError`, which caused `assign()` to fail for JSON-only agent profiles (AIM-installed Kiro CLI agents). Callers now receive `FileNotFoundError` directly and handle it gracefully.
- **Terminal-service graceful handling of missing agent profiles (#186)** — When an agent profile can't be found in the CAO store, `terminal_service` returns a clear error instead of tracebacking.
- **Missing providers in Web UI (#158, resolves #157)** — Added `gemini_cli`, `kimi_cli`, and `copilot_cli` to the `/agents/providers` endpoint and frontend fallback list so all 7 providers appear in the Web UI dropdown.
- **Web UI terminal scroll and paste reliability (#162)** — Fixes for scrollback drift and multi-line paste handling in the browser terminal.
- **WAITING_USER_ANSWER false positives from stale scrollback (#142)** — Regex hardened so historical "confirm? [y/n]" lines in scrollback don't get re-detected as active prompts.
- **Gemini skill catalog injection assertion in tests (#180)** — Test reads `GEMINI.md` rather than a hardcoded fixture so the catalog assertion tracks the live skill set.

## [1.1.0] - 2026-02-26

### Fixed

- Fix `_handoff_impl()` only accepting IDLE as ready state: providers with initial prompts reach COMPLETED after processing the system prompt; updated to accept both IDLE and COMPLETED via multi-status `wait_until_terminal_status()`
- Fix `wait_until_terminal_status()` only accepting a single status: now accepts `Union[TerminalStatus, set]` for polling multiple acceptable statuses
- Fix handoff worker IDLE wait timeout too short (30s) for slow-initializing providers: some providers can exceed 30s during shell warm-up, CLI startup, and MCP server registration; increased to 120s to act as a fallback
- Fix inbox message delivery failing for TUI-based providers: inbox service passed `tail_lines=5` to `get_status()` but TUI providers need 50+ lines to find the idle prompt; messages stayed PENDING forever because the supervisor was never detected as IDLE
- Fix inbox watchdog log tail check (`_has_idle_pattern`) using only 5 lines, which missed the idle prompt for full-screen TUI providers where the prompt sits mid-screen with 30+ padding lines below; increased to 100 lines so the watchdog reliably triggers delivery when the terminal goes IDLE
- Fix shell command injection risk in Q CLI and Kiro CLI providers: replace f-string command interpolation with `shlex.join()` for safe shell escaping of `agent_profile` values
- Fix Claude Code provider not forwarding `CAO_TERMINAL_ID` to MCP server subprocesses: inject `CAO_TERMINAL_ID` into MCP server `env` config, matching other providers
- Fix Claude Code provider failing to launch due to tmux `send-keys` corrupting single quotes in long commands; resolved by main branch's paste-buffer approach (`load-buffer` + `paste-buffer -p`)
- Add missing `wait_for_shell` call to Claude Code provider `initialize()` to match other providers
- Update Claude Code `IDLE_PROMPT_PATTERN` to match both `>` and `❯` prompt styles
- Add `_handle_trust_prompt()` to Claude Code provider to auto-accept the workspace trust dialog when opened in a new/untrusted directory; exclude trust prompt from `WAITING_USER_ANSWER` detection
- Fix Codex provider failing to launch in tmux: add warm-up `echo ready` command before starting codex to prevent immediate exit in fresh sessions
- Fix Codex idle prompt detection for `--no-alt-screen` mode: replace `\Z`-anchored regex with bottom-N-lines approach (`IDLE_PROMPT_TAIL_LINES = 5`) since inline mode keeps scrollback history
- Fix Codex trust prompt `›` falsely matching idle prompt pattern by checking trust prompt before idle prompt in `get_status()`
- Fix Codex status detection not recognizing real interactive output format: update `ASSISTANT_PREFIX_PATTERN` to match `•` bullet responses and `USER_PREFIX_PATTERN` to match `›` user input prompts, enabling `get_status()` to return `COMPLETED` for real Codex output (previously always returned `IDLE`, causing handoff/assign to time out)
- Fix `USER_PREFIX_PATTERN` crossing newline boundaries: use `[^\S\n]` (horizontal whitespace) instead of `\s` to prevent `› \n  ?` from matching as user input
- Add `IDLE_PROMPT_STRICT_PATTERN` for extraction: matches only empty prompt lines (`› ` without text) to distinguish idle prompts from user input lines
- Rewrite `extract_last_message_from_script()` to use user-message-based extraction as primary approach (works for both label and bullet formats) with assistant-marker fallback
- Fix Codex MCP `tool_timeout_sec` not taking effect: change value from `600` (TOML integer) to `600.0` (TOML float) because Codex deserializes via `Option<f64>` and silently rejects integers, falling back to the 60s default
- Fix handoff worker agents not returning results: prepend `[CAO Handoff]` context to the message in `_handoff_impl()` so the worker agent knows this is a blocking handoff and should output results directly instead of attempting to call `send_message` back to the supervisor (which fails because the worker doesn't have the supervisor's terminal ID)
- Fix Codex TUI footer causing false IDLE during handoff: `› Summarize recent commits` in the TUI status bar matched `USER_PREFIX_PATTERN` as a user message, preventing COMPLETED detection; now detects TUI footer (`? for shortcuts` / `context left`) and excludes bottom lines from user-message matching
- Fix Codex TUI progress spinner causing false COMPLETED: `• Working (0s • esc to interrupt)` matched `ASSISTANT_PREFIX_PATTERN` while TUI `›` hint matched idle prompt; added `TUI_PROGRESS_PATTERN` check to return PROCESSING when spinner is active
- Fix Codex output extraction returning TUI chrome: apply same TUI footer detection to `extract_last_message_from_script()` and use `cutoff_pos` as extraction boundary when no strict idle prompt found
- Fix Codex extraction of multi-line user messages: find first `•` assistant marker after user message instead of skipping one line, correctly handling wrapped `[CAO Handoff]` prefix text
- Fix Claude Code worker agents blocking on workspace trust prompt during handoff/assign: add `--dangerously-skip-permissions` flag to bypass trust dialog since CAO already confirms workspace trust during `cao launch`
- Fix Claude Code `PROCESSING_PATTERN` not matching newer Claude Code 2.x spinner format: broaden pattern to match both `(esc to interrupt)` and `(Ns · ↓ tokens · thinking)` formats
- Fix all providers' `send_input()` using `tmux send_keys(literal=True)` which sends characters individually, allowing TUI hotkeys to intercept user messages; replace with `send_keys_via_paste()` using `tmux set-buffer` + `paste-buffer -p` (bracketed paste mode) to bypass per-character hotkey handling

### Added

- E2E assign callback round-trip test (`test_assign_with_callback`) for all providers: verifies full assign flow where worker completes task, result is sent to supervisor's inbox, inbox message delivered (status=DELIVERED), and supervisor processes the callback
- E2E send_message test now verifies inbox message status = DELIVERED (not just stored), proving the inbox delivery pipeline works end-to-end for each provider
- E2E supervisor orchestration test now verifies no inbox messages stuck as PENDING after supervisor completes, catching inbox delivery pipeline failures
- Workspace trust confirmation prompt in `launch.py` before starting providers: asks "Do you trust all the actions in this folder?" since providers are granted full permissions (read, write, execute) in the working directory; supports `--yolo` flag to skip
- Unit tests for `TmuxClient.send_keys` validating paste-buffer delivery (`test/clients/test_tmux_send_keys.py`)
- Claude Code unit tests for `wait_for_shell` lifecycle, shell timeout, `❯` prompt detection, and ANSI-coded output
- Trust prompt handling tests (6 tests) and workspace confirmation tests (4 tests)
- Codex provider agent profile support: inject system prompt via `-c developer_instructions` config override, mirroring Claude Code's `--append-system-prompt` behavior
- Codex provider MCP server support: inject MCP servers from agent profiles via `-c mcp_servers.<name>.<field>=<value>` config overrides (per-session, no global config changes), enabling tools like `handoff` and `send_message` for multi-agent orchestration
- Codex MCP server `CAO_TERMINAL_ID` environment forwarding: automatically adds `env_vars=["CAO_TERMINAL_ID"]` to all MCP server configs so handoff can create new agent windows in the same tmux session
- Codex `_build_codex_command()` method with `shlex.join()` for safe shell escaping and proper quote/backslash/newline handling
- Codex launch flags: `--no-alt-screen` (inline mode for reliable tmux capture) and `--disable shell_snapshot` (prevent SIGTTIN in tmux)
- Codex `_handle_trust_prompt()` to auto-accept workspace trust dialog during initialization
- Codex unit tests: `TestCodexBuildCommand` (10 tests) for command building, agent profile injection, MCP server config, escaping, and error handling
- Codex bullet-format status detection tests: `TestCodexBulletFormatStatusDetection` (7 tests) for COMPLETED, PROCESSING, IDLE, code blocks, error detection, multi-turn, and TUI status bar using real `•` bullet response format
- Codex bullet-format extraction tests: `TestCodexBulletFormatExtraction` (5 tests) for single-line, multi-line, code block, multi-turn, and no-trailing-prompt extraction from `•` bullet format
- Codex TUI spinner status detection tests: `test_get_status_processing_tui_spinner`, `test_get_status_processing_tui_thinking_spinner`, `test_get_status_processing_dynamic_spinner_text` (3 tests) verifying PROCESSING is returned when TUI progress spinner is active
- Handoff message context tests: `TestHandoffMessageContext` (6 tests) in `test/mcp_server/test_handoff.py` verifying `[CAO Handoff]` prefix is prepended only for Codex provider, includes supervisor terminal ID, and preserves the original message
- Multi-agent communication protocol section added to `developer.md` and `reviewer.md` agent profiles explaining handoff vs assign behavior
- End-to-end test suite (`test/e2e/`) with 15 tests covering handoff, assign, and send_message flows across all 3 providers (codex, claude_code, kiro_cli); uses real `data_analyst` and `report_generator` profiles from `examples/assign/`; gated behind `@pytest.mark.e2e` marker, excluded from default `pytest` runs
- Provider documentation: `docs/claude-code.md` and `docs/kiro-cli.md` covering status detection, message extraction, configuration, implementation notes, E2E testing, and troubleshooting
- CI workflow `test-codex-provider.yml` for Codex provider-specific unit tests (path-triggered)
- CI workflow `test-claude-code-provider.yml` for Claude Code provider-specific unit tests (path-triggered)
- `BaseProvider.mark_input_received()` hook called by `terminal_service.send_input()` after delivering external input; allows providers to adjust status detection based on whether external input has been received since initialization
- `TmuxClient.send_keys_via_paste()` method for sending text via bracketed paste mode (`tmux set-buffer` + `paste-buffer -p`), bypassing TUI hotkey interception
- `TmuxClient.send_special_key()` method for sending tmux key sequences (e.g., `C-d`, `C-c`) non-literally, distinct from `send_keys()` which sends text literally
- Supervisor orchestration E2E tests (`test/e2e/test_supervisor_orchestration.py`): tests across providers that verify the full supervisor→worker delegation flow via MCP tools (handoff and assign+handoff), using `analysis_supervisor` profile from `examples/assign/`
- `terminal_service.send_special_key()` wrapper function for the new tmux client method
- Exit terminal endpoint key sequence routing: `POST /terminals/{terminal_id}/exit` now detects `C-`/`M-` prefixed exit commands and sends them as tmux key sequences instead of literal text
- New CLI commands: `cao info` (show session info) and `cao mcp-server` (start MCP server)
- New example profiles: `data_analyst` and `report_generator` in `examples/assign/`
- Kiro CLI provider: comprehensive docstrings and `shlex.join()` shell safety fix
- Q CLI provider: `shlex.join()` shell safety fix
- Session service: comprehensive docstrings
